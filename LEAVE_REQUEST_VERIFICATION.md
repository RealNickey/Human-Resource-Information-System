# Leave Request Functionality Verification

## Overview
This document verifies that all leave request functionality is working correctly after addressing the requirements in the issue.

## Requirements Addressed

### 1. ✅ Leave Request Approval/Rejection by Manager

**Implementation Location**: `src/components/manager-leave-requests.tsx`

**Functionality**:
- Managers can view all leave requests from all employees
- Each pending request shows two buttons: "Approve" and "Reject"
- Clicking "Approve" calls the `approve_leave` RPC function with:
  - `p_leave_id`: The ID of the leave request
  - `p_approver_employee_id`: The manager's employee ID
- Clicking "Reject" calls the `reject_leave` RPC function with the same parameters
- Both actions update the leave request status and track who approved/rejected it
- The approved leave deducts days from the employee's annual leave balance
- Toast notifications provide user feedback
- The list automatically refreshes after approval/rejection

**Database Functions**: 
- `approve_leave(p_leave_id, p_approver_employee_id)` - Sets status to 'approved', records approver and timestamp, deducts leave days
- `reject_leave(p_leave_id, p_approver_employee_id)` - Sets status to 'rejected', records approver and timestamp

### 2. ✅ Proper Display on Employee Dashboard

**Implementation Locations**: 
- `src/app/employee/dashboard/leave/page.tsx`
- `src/components/leave-history.tsx`
- `src/components/leave-request-form.tsx`

**Employee Leave Page Layout**:
The employee leave page (`/employee/dashboard/leave`) displays two main sections side by side:

**Left Section - Leave History** (`leave-history.tsx`):
- Shows **only approved** leave requests for the current year
- Displays past and upcoming/current leaves separately
- Includes: dates, leave type (with color-coded badges), days taken
- Shows total days taken this year
- Updates automatically when manager approves a request

**Right Section - Request Time Off** (`leave-request-form.tsx`):
- Form to submit new leave requests
- Shows **only pending and rejected** leave requests for the current year (last 5)
- Displays: dates, type, days, and status with color-coded badges
  - Pending: Amber/yellow badge
  - Rejected: Red badge
- Shows available leave balance at the top
- Updates automatically when:
  - New request is submitted
  - Manager approves a request (removes it from this list)
  - Manager rejects a request (updates status to rejected)

**Leave Request Flow**:
1. Employee submits leave request → Shows as "pending" in LeaveRequestForm
2. Manager approves → Disappears from LeaveRequestForm, appears in LeaveHistory
3. Manager rejects → Shows as "rejected" in LeaveRequestForm
4. Approved leaves are visible in LeaveHistory with full details

### 3. ✅ Deleted Performance Snapshot Component

**Changes Made**:
- Removed `TeamPerformance` import from `src/app/manager/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Removed `<TeamPerformance />` component usage from manager dashboard
- Updated manager dashboard description from "track performance" to "track attendance"

**Manager Dashboard Now Shows**:
1. Team Employees list
2. Attendance Tracking
3. Leave Requests (with approve/reject functionality)

### 4. ✅ Calendar Component Usage for Date Pickers

**Implementation Location**: `src/components/ui/date-picker.tsx`

**Verification**:
- The `DatePicker` component imports `Calendar` from `@/components/ui/calendar` (line 9)
- The `Calendar` component from `calendar.tsx` is rendered inside a popover (lines 65-76)
- The Calendar component uses the `react-day-picker` library with custom styling
- The DatePicker wrapper provides:
  - Popover trigger with calendar icon
  - Date formatting display
  - Hidden input for form submission
  - Date range constraints (fromDate, toDate)

**Used In**:
- `leave-request-form.tsx` - For selecting leave start and end dates
- `employee-profile-setup-form.tsx` - For selecting date of birth and joining date
- `profile-update-form.tsx` - For updating date fields

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- **leave_requests** table contains:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `employee_id`: Foreign key to employees
  - `leave_type`: Type of leave (vacation, sick, personal, etc.)
  - `start_date`: Leave start date
  - `end_date`: Leave end date
  - `days_requested`: Number of days (calculated)
  - `reason`: Optional reason text
  - `status`: 'pending', 'approved', or 'rejected'
  - `approved_by`: Employee ID of approver (manager)
  - `approved_at`: Timestamp of approval/rejection
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of request creation

### Security
- Row-level security ensures employees can only see their own leave requests
- Managers can view all leave requests but can only approve/reject if they have manager role
- Database functions verify manager role before allowing approve/reject operations

### Real-Time Updates
- Both components use `createClient()` from Supabase for data fetching
- Components reload data after mutations (submit, approve, reject)
- Status changes are immediately reflected in the UI

## Build Verification

✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completed without errors
✅ Lint check passed: Only 2 pre-existing warnings (unrelated to changes)
✅ TypeScript compilation: No type errors
✅ All routes compiled successfully

## Summary

All requirements from the issue have been successfully addressed:

1. ✅ **Leave request approval/rejection by manager**: Fully functional via ManagerLeaveRequests component
2. ✅ **Proper display on employee dashboard**: LeaveHistory shows approved leaves, LeaveRequestForm shows pending/rejected
3. ✅ **Deleted performance snapshot**: TeamPerformance component removed from manager dashboard
4. ✅ **Calendar component usage**: DatePicker properly uses Calendar from calendar.tsx

The leave request workflow is complete and working correctly from employee submission through manager approval/rejection and back to employee visibility.
