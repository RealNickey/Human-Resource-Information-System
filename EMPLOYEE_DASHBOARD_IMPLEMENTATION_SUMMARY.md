# Employee Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the employee dashboard workflow implementation, including all features, components, and design decisions.

## ‚úÖ Requirements Implementation Status

### 1. First-Time Login Flow ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: After a user logs in for the first time, prompt them to enter and save their personal information.

**Implementation**:
- `src/app/employee/dashboard/page.tsx` checks if employee profile exists
- If no profile: Shows `EmployeeProfileSetupForm` component
- Form includes all required and optional fields
- Profile cannot be skipped - dashboard features are hidden until profile is created

**File**: `src/components/employee-profile-setup-form.tsx`

### 2. Automatic Redirect ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: If personal information is already filled, automatically redirect to main dashboard.

**Implementation**:
- Server action `createEmployeeProfile` in `actions.ts` calls `redirect("/employee/dashboard")` on success
- Page reloads automatically and finds existing profile
- Full dashboard is rendered immediately
- No manual navigation needed

**File**: `src/app/employee/dashboard/actions.ts` (line with `redirect()`)

### 3. Personal Information Section ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: Display all saved personal details for the user.

**Implementation**:
- `EmployeePersonalInfo` component shows:
  - Avatar with initials
  - Employee ID (auto-generated)
  - Full name
  - Department
  - Email
  - Date of birth
  - Date of joining
- Clearly labeled with section header "üìã Personal Information"

**File**: `src/components/employee-personal-info.tsx`

### 4. Attendance Tracker ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: Show the user's attendance record.

**Implementation**:
- `AttendanceSummary` component provides:
  - Monthly navigation (previous/next month)
  - Summary metrics: Days present, absent, leave days, hours logged
  - Weekly trend chart (8-week line chart)
  - Detailed table with date, status, and hours
  - Color-coded status badges
- Section header "üìä Attendance Tracker"

**File**: `src/components/attendance-summary.tsx`

### 5. Leave History ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: List the dates or days on which the user has previously taken leave.

**Implementation**:
- **New Component**: `LeaveHistory` specifically for showing approved leave
- Displays:
  - Total days taken this year
  - Upcoming/current leave (separate section)
  - Past leave with actual dates
  - Color-coded leave types
  - Date ranges clearly formatted
- Only shows APPROVED leaves (not pending/rejected)
- Part of "üèñÔ∏è Leave Management" section

**File**: `src/components/leave-history.tsx` (newly created)

### 6. Request Time Off Form ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: Provide a form component with "From Date" and "To Date" fields.

**Implementation**:
- **New Component**: `LeaveRequestForm` dedicated to requesting time off
- Fields:
  - Leave Type (dropdown with 6 options)
  - **From Date** (date picker, prevents past dates)
  - **To Date** (date picker, validates end > start)
  - Reason (optional textarea)
- Shows remaining leave balance prominently
- Displays pending/rejected requests below form
- Real-time validation and feedback
- Part of "üèñÔ∏è Leave Management" section

**File**: `src/components/leave-request-form.tsx` (newly created)

### 7. Salary Information ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: Display current salary details with increment/decrement logic based on performance.

**Implementation**:
- `SalaryInformation` component (enhanced) shows:
  - Current salary with effective date
  - Change indicator (increment/decrement with visual arrows)
  - Last evaluation rating
  - **Performance Impact Section** (new):
    - Shows last 2 performance evaluations
    - Displays rating, score, goals achieved
    - Shows salary adjustment percentage
    - Shows bonus amounts
    - Color-coded (green for positive, red for negative)
  - Salary history table (last 5 records)
- Explains how performance affects salary
- Section header "üí∞ Salary Information"

**File**: `src/components/salary-information.tsx` (enhanced)

### 8. Access Restriction ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: Restrict dashboard access until personal info is saved.

**Implementation**:
- Conditional rendering in `page.tsx`:
  ```typescript
  {employee ? (
    // Show full dashboard
  ) : (
    // Show only profile setup form
  )}
  ```
- No way to bypass the form
- All dashboard features hidden until profile exists
- Form is the only thing visible to new users

**File**: `src/app/employee/dashboard/page.tsx`

### 9. Maximize Component Reuse ‚úÖ
**Requirement**: Use as many UI components as possible from the components folder.

**Implementation**:
- **UI Components Used** (from `src/components/ui/`):
  - `card`, `button`, `input`, `label`, `select`
  - `table`, `skeleton`, `avatar`, `badge`
  - `chart` (for attendance visualization)
  - `dialog`, `drawer`, `dropdown-menu`
  - `textarea`, `breadcrumb`, `calendar`
- **Feature Components** (from `src/components/`):

  - `attendance-summary.tsx`
  - `leave-history.tsx` (new)
  - `leave-request-form.tsx` (new)
  - `salary-information.tsx` (enhanced)
